# NHL Data Processing

## Assignment Focus Areas
- **Web Crawling**
- **Vertical and Horizontal Integration**
- **Data Preprocessing and Cleaning Techniques**
- **Data Modeling using ggplot**
- **R Markdown to Accompany R script**

### Overview and Purpose

The accompanying R Markdown file, compiled into an HTML output, presents a comprehensive analysis of NHL data. Focused on web crawling, data integration, preprocessing, and visualization, this project demonstrates key techniques for data enthusiasts.

### Project Highlights

1. **Web Crawling:**
   - Utilizing web scraping techniques to gather NHL data from multiple pages efficiently.

2. **Data Integration:**
   - Merging data from different sources, incorporating information from an Excel file and a CSV file into the analysis.

3. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Employing techniques like whitespace removal, type conversion, and error correction to ensure data accuracy.

4. **Data Modeling with ggplot:**
   - Visualizing NHL data using the powerful ggplot2 library, showcasing team wins, win percentages, and arena capacities.

5. **R Markdown and HTML Output:**
   - Creating a dynamic R Markdown document with embedded code, results, and narratives, compiled into an HTML report. This serves as a transparent and reproducible record of the analysis.

### How to Use

1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure you have R installed along with the required libraries (ggplot2, xml2, readxl).
3. Run the provided R script.

### Key Visualizations

- **NHL Teams > 40 Wins in 1990:**
  - A bar chart showcasing NHL teams with over 40 wins in the year 1990.

- **Philadelphia Flyers Wins Over the Years:**
  - A line chart illustrating the win performance of the Philadelphia Flyers over different years.

- **Distribution of Win Percentages by Team:**
  - A boxplot visualizing the distribution of win percentages for each NHL team.

- **NHL Win Percentage Over the Years:**
  - A stacked bar chart representing the win percentage of NHL teams across multiple years.

- **NHL Arena Capacities:**
  - A bar chart displaying the capacities of NHL arenas, highlighting team-specific capacities.

## R Markdown Purpose
The R Markdown file, accompanied by an HTML output, serves as a dynamic and accessible medium for conveying data analysis and visualizations. By encapsulating code, results, and narratives in a single document, it becomes an invaluable tool for both programmers and non-programmers.

For programmers, the R Markdown file provides a comprehensive record of the data processing steps, analyses, and visualizations, fostering transparency and reproducibility in research or data projects. The embedded code allows fellow developers to understand, modify, and build upon the work efficiently.

For those unfamiliar with programming, the HTML-rendered R Markdown file serves as an interactive report, distilling complex analyses into visually engaging and easy-to-understand narratives. This intermediary layer facilitates communication between data practitioners and stakeholders, offering insights without requiring deep technical knowledge. The document can be conveniently shared, allowing others to explore the findings interactively, making data-driven decision-making more accessible and collaborative.
